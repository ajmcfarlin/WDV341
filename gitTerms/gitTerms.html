    <h2>Version Control Software</h2>
    <p>Version control software is something many developers use, especially through Git. This software helps track and manage every bit of code changes and stores each change in a database. This way, if mistakes are made or something happens, each stage of the code can be revisited to create a kind of safety net for developers and their teams. </p>

    <h2>Add</h2>
    <p>The Git add command is used by developers as a way to create an accumulation of changes that they want to be updated. The add command does not actually change the repository until the commit command is executed. This seems to add another layer of security for review prior to commiting changes. </p>

    <h2>Commit</h2>
    <p>As mentioned above, the Git commit command is used to actually make the changes to the repository that were created during the Git add process. These commit commands make up the stages and snapshots of code mentioned in the version control software. </p> 

    <h2>Push</h2>
    <p>The Git push command is used by developers to upload information and code from their local repository into the remote repository. </p>
    
    <h2>Pull</h2>
    <p>The Git pull request is used by developers to request or get data. The pull request is used to update a local or individual repository from the remote or team repository </p>
    
    <h2>Clone</h2>
    <p>The Git clone command allows a developer to make a copy of their repository and store it somewhere else or create a local copy. </p>
